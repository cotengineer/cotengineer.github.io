                <h2>Website Designs</h2>
                <p>Website Designs are one of the main products we deliver here at Special-T-Support! In this day and age, it is crucial for a business to have a website!
                    This tells customers that you are serious about doing business because you are invested in it. Also, having a website makes you more trustworthy as opposed to only using social media for business.
                    And last but not least, having a website establishes your presence online. This allows more customers to find you and for business to be conducted internationally. With prices starting as low as $75 and the quality we offer, our clients satisfaction is guarenteed! 
                </p>
                <p>We offer a number of customized website types such as:
                    <ul>

                <h2>Application Development</h2>
                <p>Apps are another major service offered by us. This is a great way to stand out from the competition! 
                    Every major business gains a massive amount of growth once they release an app for their business. 
                    Having an app practically guarentees that a customer will return repeatedly to do business. 
                    This is because of the convenience of having an app on a mobile device and having a brand constantly reminding them of its presence. 
                    Fortunately, we create a variety of apps, including apps for a professional event, social party, or special occasion! 
                </p>
                <p> The types of applications that we develop are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Web Apps</li>
                        <li>Mobile Google & Android Apps</li>

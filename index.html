            <h2>Website Designs</h2>
            <p>Website Designs are one of the main products we deliver here at Special-T-Support! In this day and age, it is crucial for a business to have a website! This tells customers that you are serious about doing business because you are invested in it. Also, having a website makes you more trustworthy as opposed to only using social media for business. And last but not least, having a website establishes your presence online. This allows more customers to find you and for business to be conducted internationally.</p>
            <h2>App Development</h2>
            <p>Apps are another major service offered by us. This is a great way to stand out from the competition! Every major business gains a massive amount of growth once they release an app for their business. Having an app practically guarentees that a customer will return repeatedly to do business. This is because of the convenience of having an app on a mobile device and having a brand constantly reminding them of its presence. Fortunately, we create a variety of apps suited for our customers' needs.</p>
            <h2>Custom Software</h2>
            <p>The main bulk of the services offered by us are Websites and Applications. However, there are more options available that can be suited to a specific customer's business need. This includes software for special occassions, professional events, data mining, and day to day services! If you desire an item that has not been posted here, then feel free to contact us and inquire about your idea.  </p>

        <h1>Pricing</h1>
        <p>The baseline for offered service prices are listed below. Some additional costs, if necessary, should be expected to cover unavoidable items. For example, the cost to reserve a unique web domain name for a [.com] website is usually under $10. However, this price reserves the domain for a year before a renewal is required. Overall, these prices are a great starting point, but may change depending on services added or taken away. </p>
